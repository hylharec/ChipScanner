Input:
    W: 640                      # (int) resolution of pictures snapped through MicroManager
    H: 512                      #

    input_bit_depth: 14         # (int) Bit depth of pictures snapped through Micromanager
    cast_bit_depth: 16          # (int) Target bit depth to cast input pictures to (should be 8, 16 or 32)
    cast_dtype: "uint16"        # (str) Name of Numpy dtype to cast input pictures to (= intensity range will be adjusted to match new type)

# Experiment preparation:
# Zero should be set so that the middle of the image is the corner of the chip where all
# locations of the chip are positive x and y values.

Experiment:
    x_end_um: 3473              # (int) Coordinates where the end corner of chip is in the middle of the camera
    y_end_um: 3593              #

    x_margin_um:   100          # (int) Margins around the chip to include correcly it's edges in the final picture
    y_margin_um:   100          #

    coverage_overlap: 0.6       # (float) Percentage of overlap to expect between consecutive pictures [0.0, 1.0[
    lens: 20                    # (5, 20 or 50) Magnification used
    pixel_pitch_um: 15.0        # (float) See camera datasheet
    cam2motor_angle: 0.01       # (float) (rad) Rotational misalignment between camera and XY stage
    only_merge: True            # (bool) Set to True to prevent new pictures to be taken and directly jump to the merging process when launching main.py
    skip_setup: True            # (bool) Set to True to prevent manual runtime exposure, zero pos and end pos setting sequence in main.py

# Autofocus params depend on the lens used.
# Usually:
# x50 -> good focus z ranges between -/+ 10 um
# x20 -> good focus z ranges between -/+ 20 um
# Initial step size should not be too big for good results.
Autofocus:
    enable: True
    z_step_size_um: 2.0         # (float) Starting step size of autofocus
    max_tries: 20               # (int) Prevents autofocus from running forever if it does not converge
    min_step_size: 0.25         # (float) After each direction change the step size is /2 until it is < this value
    max_abs_z_um: 80.0          # (float) z values are clamped within this amplitude from 0 for safety (WARNING: will prevent good autofocus if too small)
    min_rating_threshold: 300   # (int) If the autofocus ends with a rating below this value, it will revert to the z before the start of the autofocus. (0 to disable feature)
    rough_scan_abs_z_um: 40.0   # (float) At start of autofocus, will take a number of pictures at z levels in this range around the previous focus z to choose the best starting z.
    rough_scan_nb: 6            # (int) At start of autofocus, number of pictures to take in set range around previous focus z.
